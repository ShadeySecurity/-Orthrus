# -Orthrus
Python Border Security Platform

Most of the different open source firewalls all tend to use PHP at their base, and have a slew of configurations before you get a secure box meant to do security. 
Orthrus is different, it is built with security as the primary, and forces you to open hole into the system as needed. The project utilizes a stripped down ubuntu 16.04 LTS minimal install, web2py,
and Python to accomplish the protection of the herd of systems you rely on. Orthrus will not be a platform that does everything. We at Shadey Security believe you should have your platforms do one thing, 
and one thing well!
